### Creation

To create a document that the *Makers* sees as a valid document the President, Secretary, or Treasurer (Senior Executive). The actionee and the Senior Executive will discuss what classifcation, who is the champion of the document (a person who is responsible for the upkeep of the document), and if the classification requires it the people required to approve the document. 

Once a decision is agreeded apon then the document is created by Senior Executive in a secure place and the agreed personnel are given access to edit the document. All members of the *Makers* have the right to add suggestions to the document. 

### Build

In this stage the main build out of the document is commenced with the champion/authorised personnel creating the bulk of the document and other members suggesting additional changes. This is the largest step of the document creation process.

### Review

The document is then reviewed by the champion and create a breif description of the changes to the document. This is also the stage where most of the suggested changes are considered and added in.

### Approval

The document is then published to the relevant authority body for approval. They will decide if the document is correct and they place the *Makers* Seal of Approval to officiate the document. The approval body may also request the document to be pushed into the build stage if required.

#### Bypass

The bypass is only for *Green* documents as they do not require approval from a governing body.

### Release

After the approval body has approved the document the document is then converted to a PDF and published in a read-only publicly accessable place.

### Change Request

If a member of *Makers* has requested then the champion of the document will need to review the change request and determine if the change is nessosary. If the champion needs to change the document then the document goes back into the *Build* stage.
